# World-data
Data related to diferent aspects of the world (it's countries, cities, languages, etc...), in json formats.

Most of this files are acquired through python web crawler scripts.

The porpuse for this is to facilitate the people who need this data for their projects and don't have access to it easily, I needed some of this data myself and didn't find any files/formats that could help me intregrate the data on my projects, and i thought: "I'm sure i'm not the only one needing this", so here it is, enjoy.

You're welcome to give me any ideias, new data to scrape etc...
